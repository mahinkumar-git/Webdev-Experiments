        <p>Every day atleast 12000 vehicles pass through the Gedilam river bridge. The older Bridge was constructed on 1864 during the french regime.
           the newer one nearby was very recently constructed. As the intensity of vehicle passing by grew over time. The Bridge now connects the most
        the important parts of the city and remains a very busy spot. </p>
